.SYNOPSIS
    Deploys the release's static site to the deployable's Static Web App, with the topology of the whole system.

.DESCRIPTION
    Step "Update deployable" of an Octopus project <slug>-<deployable> whose deployable is a static site (system.json
    hosting "staticwebapp": the health dashboard); octopus/projects.tf inlines this file. The package reference "site"
    is the zip the dashboard's release workflow pushed to the Octopus built-in feed (<slug>-<deployable>.<version>.zip,
    index.html at its root), extracted. The site is the one the stack created (stack output deployables[].staticSite).

    1. topology.json, written next to index.html (the contract is in the dashboard repository's README): every
       environment of system.json on main and, in each, the deployables whose nodes are known:
       - hosting "appservice": its nodes by naming convention, app-<slug>-<env>-<deployable> in system.location
         (primary) and, when the environment has a standbyLocation, app-<slug>-<env>-<deployable>-<region>
         (standby). An environment with capability "frontdoor" also gets the address of its Front Door endpoint,
         read from the system's profile (azure.frontDoor).
       - hosting "own": what the application reported when it was last verified there, the deployable's entry in
         environments/<env>/nodes.json on main (scripts/record-nodes.ps1 records it): its nodes, its paths and
         its own public address. What system.json says of every deployable comes with it (projectUrl, telemetryPath,
         trafficPaths, buildPath, healthDetailPath, below); a health path it did not report is the deployable's
         healthPath of system.json. It has no links: the system does not know the application's resources. Without
         a record in an environment the deployable is left out of that environment, and the log says so. A record
         that breaks the rules stops the step: it would break the dashboard's page.
       Container-app deployables are left out: their address is not a convention (the platform generates it, and a
       placement changes it), so the dashboard does not show them.
       The topology also says where the dashboard finds what the deployments pinned. Every address is a convention
       over system.json and none is a secret:
         system.repository      https://github.com/<system.githubOrg>/<system.repository>, the system repository
         versionsUrl            per environment: environments/<env>/versions.json on main, as
                                raw.githubusercontent.com serves it to a browser without a token (the repository is
                                public)
         versionsHistoryUrl     per environment: the commits of that file on github.com
         projectUrl             per deployable: <octopus.url>/app#/<octopus.spaceId>/projects/<slug>-<deployable>,
                                its Octopus project
       The dashboard compares the pinned version with the version each node reports and links to the project and to
       the history. An address whose parts system.json does not give is null, and the dashboard leaves that part out.
       What the dashboard shows beyond health comes the same way, each part optional:
         telemetryPath, buildPath, trafficPaths, healthDetailPath
                                per deployable, carried from system.json (deployables[]): where a node reports its
                                calls and its process, where it reports the build it runs, what the traffic button
                                calls, and where it answers its detailed health check (one entry per dependency
                                it checks: name, status, description, duration)
         system.deliveryUrl     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<githubOrg>/<repository>/status/delivery.json: the
                                delivery facts a workflow of the system repository publishes to its branch "status"
         system.costUrl         https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<githubOrg>/<repository>/status/cost.json: what each
                                environment cost in Azure, which the same workflow publishes next to it
         system.deploymentsUrl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<githubOrg>/<repository>/deployments/deployments.json:
                                the deployments in flight, which workflow deployments publishes to its branch
                                "deployments" (scripts/write-deployments.ps1)
         system.dashboard       { name, buildPath }: this deployable itself, when system.json gives it a buildPath
                                (deployables[<this deployable>].buildPath, "/build-facts.json": the file the
                                dashboard's Build writes next to index.html) and the release has that file. The page
                                reads it from its own address and shows the Code card of the dashboard. Without the
                                key in system.json the topology has no such entry and is as before; a release from
                                before the Build wrote the file gets none either, which is logged as information
         links                  where a number or a name of the page leads, all in the Azure portal, which asks the
                                viewer to sign in (the page holds no credential). Resource ids are conventions over
                                system.json (azure.subscriptionId, azure.resourceGroups, the names the stack gives):
                                  nodes[].links        portal (the web app) and, in an environment with capability
                                                       "telemetry", liveMetrics, performance, failures (blades of
                                                       appi-<slug>-<env>) and dependencies (a Logs query of the
                                                       dependency calls of role <slug>-<deployable>)
                                  deployables[].links  frontDoor (the profile azure.frontDoor, where the environment
                                                       has an endpoint) and logs (a Logs query of the role's requests)
                                  environments[].pages a page of the system itself, per deployable that names one
                                                       (dashboardLink in system.json): its words and the address the
                                                       deployable has in that environment, read from the stack
                                  environments[].links resourceGroup, applicationInsights and applicationMap (with
                                                       "telemetry") and database (sqldb-<slug>-<env>)
                                The database's server has a generated suffix, so its name is read from Azure
                                (az sql server list in the tier's resource group). A read that fails or is denied
                                (the deploy identity of one tier may not read the other's group) is logged as
                                information and leaves that link out.
    2. runtime/, next to topology.json: per environment of system.json a C4 deployment diagram (PlantUML source
       <env>.puml, the SVG <env>.svg and its manifest <env>.json), and index.json, the list of them (the contract is in
       the dashboard repository's README, "The runtime view"). The diagram is drawn from the topology and system.json:
       Azure subscription > resource group (the tier's, and azure.frontDoor.resourceGroup) > region (primary
       system.location, standby, the database's system.sqlLocation, the static sites' system.staticLocation) > App
       Service plan (asp-<slug>-<first environment of the tier>, asp-<slug>-<first environment of the tier with that
       standby>-<region>; size system.planSku.<tier>, F1 without it and while azure.frontDoor.dormant) > web app; the
       Front Door endpoint in the profile; the database sqldb-<slug>-<env>, in an environment that has one (an app in
       it uses it: the rule of infra/main.bicep); the static sites; the browser. An application that brings its own
       runtime (hosting "own") is drawn outside the subscription, in a boundary of its own, because the system does
       not know where it runs: its public address when it reported one, and its nodes by the regions they name, each
       with the tile of a web app; the browser calls the public address, or each node without one. Outside the
       subscription, one box per dependency a deployable declares (system.json deployables[].dependencies, a list of
       { "name": "LLM gateway", "healthCheck": "LlmGateway", "kind": "external" }: the name shown, the entry of the
       detailed health check that tells its state, and what it is, free text), with an arrow from each of the
       deployable's web apps; the manifest lists it as a node of kind "dependency" with that entry's name. Without
       dependencies the diagram has none of this. Every node, region and Front Door, database or dependency
       relationship has a slot, a transparent image of a fixed size, where the dashboard draws the live values (a web
       app's slot holds seven lines under its badge: version, pin, traffic, failures, process, uptime and role, and
       an eighth, the marks of its detailed health check, for a deployable with healthDetailPath; then two more, as
       the slot of every node a deployment changes has: what is being deployed there and what just happened, in
       words, from deployments.json). The script downloads the PlantUML release jar of the pinned version from GitHub,
       verifies its SHA-256, renders every diagram in one Java process (layout engine smetana: no Graphviz; security
       profile SANDBOX) and checks that each SVG has every element the manifest names; a missing one fails the step.
       Java's output is logged as information; the download and the render are timed.
       The manifest also says where each box leads that topology.json has no link for (the frames, the regions, the
       Static Web App, the browser: "links", see ConvertTo-RuntimeDiagram), so a click on any box of the page's
       runtime view opens what the box stands for.
       The database view (decision 0040), in the same folder: per environment that has a record of its tables on main
       (environments/<env>/database.json, committed by step "Record database schema" of a deployable that migrates
       the database), a C4 diagram <env>.database.puml, its SVG and its manifest <env>.database.json, with a box per
       table (its row count and its columns), an arrow per pair of tables a foreign key joins, and the entry
       "database" of that environment in index.json; the dashboard zooms from the database box into it. The names
       are an application's and are written as text only (ConvertTo-DatabaseDiagram). A record that cannot be read
       or drawn is one warning and no view; "databaseView": false on "system" in system.json switches it off.
       The application view (decision 0041): the manifest's node of a web app or a container app names, as
       "architecture", the public address where the repository of its deployable (deployables[].repository) publishes
       the logical architecture of each release (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/<repository>/architecture/
       <deployable>; <version>.json and <version>.svg, written by workflow Architecture of that repository). The page
       zooms from the box into the diagram of the version that runs. Nothing is drawn here for it. A repository the
       public cannot read (github.com answers 404 to a request without a credential) gets no address: its box is as
       before. "applicationView": false on "system" in system.json leaves the address out of every box.
    3. The deployment, with the Static Web Apps CLI and the site's deployment token. The token is read from Azure
       when the step runs (the deploy identity may; the stack's deny settings keep everyone else from listing it),
       reaches the CLI through an environment variable, and is never stored, printed or passed as an argument.
    4. The proof: the site serves the topology this step wrote.
    With hosting "storagewebsite", 3 and 4 are Publish-StorageWebsite of scripts/deploy-storagewebsite.ps1, which
    octopus/projects.tf joins in before this script: the static website of the storage account the stack created.

    The topology is a picture of system.json and the recorded nodes at the time of the deployment. After a change to
    the environments, a standby region or a Front Door endpoint, or a deployment of an application with hosting "own"
    that changed its nodes, deploy the dashboard's release again in every environment that has it:
    until then its page shows the old picture, the runtime diagrams too. An environment that is in system.json but not applied yet shows its
    nodes as unreachable. The pinned versions are not part of the picture: the dashboard reads versions.json itself,
    every time it checks the nodes.

    #
    # Links: where a box leads when the topology has no link for it. The manifest lists every frame that is no region
    # ("frames": alias, qualifiedName, kind, name) and gives a frame, a region or a node "links", a map of one key:
    #   portal     the resource's page in the Azure portal, from its id: the subscription, a resource group, the Front
    #              Door profile, an App Service plan, a Static Web App. Without azure.subscriptionId there is none.
    #   resources  a region of the system: the resources of the tier's resource group in that region, a query in Azure
    #              Resource Graph Explorer (Get-ResourcesAddress)
    #   project    the boundary of an application with its own runtime: its Octopus project (the topology's projectUrl)
    #   site       an address a browser opens: the browser's box (the first public address of the diagram), and the
    #              public address and the nodes of an application with its own runtime
    # A web app, a Front Door endpoint and the database have their links in topology.json, as before; a dependency
    # and the region of an application with its own runtime have none: the system knows no address for them.
    #
    # The container apps the system creates (hosting "containerapp", the default) are drawn too, from -ContainerApp
    # (environment, then deployable, to the address the environment's stack reports: their addresses are generated, no
    # convention names them). A Container Apps environment is a box under the subscription, named after its address
    # (the part of the host name the platform generates) and its region, with a box per app:

    #   ca_<d>                      a container app; kind "containerapp" in the manifest, its address in "url" and in

    #   browser-to-ca_<d>           its public address (kind "direct": the page marks no number on it)
